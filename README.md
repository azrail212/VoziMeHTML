# VoziMeHCI
VoziMe! Is an idea of an application whose primary audience would
              be young people who use smartphones in their everyday lives, as well as all those who can navigate through a simple
              application. The goal is to make taxis as accessible as possible, so that we do not have to call several phone numbers
              to get a vehicle to pick us up. Feel free to login on the left and then ... <b>Enjoy!</b>
